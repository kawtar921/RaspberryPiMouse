The program runs on a Raspberry Pi connected to a Raspicam and displays on a 480x320 screen a menu that allows the user to choose the mouse movement and the type of click (simple click, double click, right click, drag and drop).
These choices will be sent to the machine using the HID protocol.
The Raspberry Pi is also advertized as a mouse using the SDP protocol.
